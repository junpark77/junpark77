# Jun Park

Hi I'm Jun, a mechanical engineer turned software engineer!
I've worked 5 years in the aerospace industry.

I love to solve problems whether mechanical or computational, and software engineering seemed fast paced and ever growing, so I decided to make the switch by attending Hack Reactor in 2021.
On this profile, you'll find various projects I've done, some personal and some in Hack Reactor.
Feel free to reach out!
